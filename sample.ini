; Sample .ini file for the Islandora Fetch Bags tool

[general]
; Where you want your Bags to be saved. Must exist.
output_dir = '/tmp/marksbags'

; Directory for saving fetched files temporarily. Must exist.
; Important: Always use a specific directory for 'temp_dir'
; (and not '/tmp') since its contents are deleted after Bags are created.
temp_dir = '/tmp/fetchbags';

; Your site's base URL.
islandora_base_url = 'http://digital.lib.sfu.ca';

[objects]
; 'solr_query' is used to retrieve the PIDs of objects you want to create Bags for. The
; one in this sample queries for objects whose namespace is 'hiv', with a limit of 20.
; If you want to retrieve _all_ the PIDs possible, set the 'rows' parameter to
; a ridiculously high value like 1000000.
solr_query = "PID:hiv\:*?fl=PID&rows=20"

; 'pid_file' is the full path to to a file listing one PID per row. // and # can
; be used to comment out lines. Note that 'pid_file' and 'solr_query' are
; mutually exclusive.
; pid_file = "/tmp/create_bags_for_these_pids.txt'
